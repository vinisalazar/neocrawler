### Neocrawler

This is a repository to crawl the [Bacterio webpage](http://www.bacterio.net/) using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org). The goal is to extract all 16S rRNA entries associated with a taxonomy.

Also, this is my attempt at learning some web crawling.

[data](./data) contains the built Blast database.  
[neocrawler](./neocrawler) contains scripts.

Made with :heart: for the best microbiome company.
